# FFXIV Data Exporter
My fourth attempt at a decent exporter for FFXIV's data files.
This will
  1. export CSV, image and sound files via SaintCoinach.
  2. convert .ogg files to .wav to add to editors like Audacity or whathaveyou.
  3. convert .wav files to .mp3 for your listening pleasure.
  4. get all weather patterns for all zones as well as moon phases for any time frame.
